# Things I like:
- That the book acknowledges the idea of projects going on and on with no end in sight as this is something that I personally experienced.
- The idea of creating a balance in overall time allocated(6 weeks for example) whereby it is just short enough for people to race against the deadline but long enough for meaningful work to be completed
- Self-regulation and autonomy over micromanagement. Allows teams to focus on making the details good with an overall agreement of the direction and abstract concept of the goal product
- Promotes project ownership by allowing teams to take on projects from start to finish rather than tickets

# Things I dislike:
- unfamiliar unnecessary terminology
- Complexity of diagrams
- lack of flexibility on the 6 week time restriction
- focus on big picture may cause issues in some project-defining details
- 6 weeks feels too long. I like short sprints that allow me to reach shorter milestones and feel myself acheiving some sort of progress even if small that will help keep me going.

# Open-ended questions:
- Is there evidence to back up the concept of ensuring all projects take 6 weeks?
- Are there any stats that show the success of Shape Up?
- What happens when 6 weeks is not a good estimate and the project cannot be broken down to smaller pieces? 
- How do we manage projects over a long period of time?
