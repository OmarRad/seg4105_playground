## Sprint
### Team: Omar, Ismail, Zakariya, Jonathan, Logan
#### Awesome and should keep doing:
- Keeping each other updated on our progress
- Offering help and working together to tackle issues and help solve each other's problems
#### Should stop doing:
- Limit the length of our stand-ups since it is a time where everyone is present and some issues discussed don't require everyone to be present
#### New things to try out:
Formulate our tests prior to writing code to help with requirements traceability and ensuring that what we build alines with the requirements
#### Things out of our control:
- School work/exams
- Online
